# ImgPortfolio
## An "Instagram-like" Template App

To get the app running, I used Expo CLI for initializing and running the app in an Android Studio emulator.
I recommend using Expo for convenience of use.

### About

This app is a simple project to work on React-Native page stylings and navigation. As it stands, everything is implemented that I had originally hoped to work on. There is an array storing image IDs that allows users to scroll through many images that dynamically load in. Users can also click on an image to get a better (larger image, more pixels) view.

### Running the App

Once you have cloned the project, simply run `expo start` from the parent directory and follow the instructions from the CLI to get the app running.

### Usage

Feel free to clone this project and use it how you see fit. I may return to work on more features, but again I got what I wanted to from this project. For now I am going to be working on a companion app for one of my favorite video games: Noita.
